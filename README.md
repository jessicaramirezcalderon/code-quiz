# Code Quiz
This is a 10 question code quiz. The application gives the user 180 seconds to complete the ten questions. After the 10 questions are answered, the user is then taken to a page where they can enter their initials in order to retrieve their final results. Each question answered incorrectly takes away 20 seconds from the user.
